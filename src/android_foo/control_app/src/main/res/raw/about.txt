  About ROS Control

  This app is the result of a Senior Project to design an Android application to
  control a robot.Our goal was to create an Android application (optimized for tablets)
  to interface with a Robot Operating System (ROS) robot, for direct drive, diagnostic,
  and navigation information. The application processes data from various sensors
  on the robot and displays the information in an understandable fashion.

  1. The Overview:
         The overview option in the navigation drawer shows both the view from the
         robots camera,and what the laser scan is seeing. In the laser scan portion
         of the overview, you can drop waypoints by using a long press and delete
         them using the same motion.
